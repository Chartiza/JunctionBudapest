## Project description
Our mission is to innovate, support and simplify cancer-fighting solutions. We provide a simple way to any person to analyse the ones genotype in order to quantify their cancer risk. We used python custom scripts, django framework and web design. Our solution is based on standard genotype panel(e.g. 23andme). We focused on the two mostly wide-spread cancers (breast and lung) and took into analysis main genes. We provide the unique tool of cancer risk estimation, based on open research data. Cancerometer is epic invention because it makes every person a researcher and gives not only simple and useful but also accurate prediction on early stage. The obtained data can be used by the both â€“ patients, doctors and medical specialists.
